## Young Adults:

- check if 119, 120 can be included (`pain_data` timestamps is off by an hour and something with other signal data and facial expressions)
  - by Feb 12

## Older Adults:

- upload a folder of proofread facial action units, thermal video, and depth video with documentations

  - code that extracts the per-frame FAUs
  - meta data of each modality (FPS, start and end timestamps)

## Logistics:

- Submit to a dataset journal. Content should refer to the PhysioPain dataset: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2025.111992](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2025.111992 "Persistent link using digital object identifier")
