## Young Adults:

- Upload a merged physiological signal csv file using the same pipeline in older adults
  - by Feb 11
- check if 119, 120 can be included (`pain_data` timestamps is off by an hour and something with other signal data and facial expressions)
  - by Feb 12

## Older Adults:

- change names of original files(`003-3YK9K1J2D2` to `001-3YK9K1J2D2`, etc.)
- upload a single merged data file, e.g., in .feather format (need to run through the whole pipeline due to reorganization and refactoring of code)

  - by Feb 12
- upload a folder of proofread facial action units, thermal video, and depth video with documentations

  - code that extracts the per-frame FAUs
    - by Feb 13
  - meta data of each modality (FPS, start and end timestamps)
    - by Feb 12


## Logistics:

- Notify nurses and submit to a dataset journal. Content should refer to the PhysioPain dataset: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2025.111992](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2025.111992 "Persistent link using digital object identifier")
- Make github repo public after ensuring its functionality and readability.
  - Include both .ipynb for demonstration and .py scripts.
